# Double-Niched Evolutionary Algorithm (DNEA) for Multi-Modal Multi-Objective Optimization (PPSN 2018 &amp; CEC 2019)

Copyright 2018-2019 Yiping Liu

These are the codes of DNEA and DNEA-L.

DNEA was proposed in "Yiping Liu, Hisao Ishibuchi, Yusuke Nojima, Naoki Masuyama and Ke Shang. A Double-Niched Evolutionary Algorithm and its Behaviors on Polygon-Based Problems. Proceedings of Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN 2018), 263-273."

DNEA-L was propsoed in "Yiping Liu, Hisao Ishibuchi, Yusuke Nojima, Naoki Masuyama and Yuanyan Han. Searching for Local Pareto Optimal Solutions: A Case Study on Polygon-Based Problems. Proceedings of IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC 2019). (in press)"

The codes use PlatEMO (v1.6) published in "Ye Tian et al., PlatEMO: A MATLAB Platform for Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization, IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine, 2017, 12(4): 73-87".
